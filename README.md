# Decision-Tree-Linear-Regression-and-Prediction-

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Regression model for predicting continuous outcomes, such as academic performance scores. The Decision Tree algorithm is a powerful machine learning technique that can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

Project Description
The project involves loading a dataset containing information about students' academic performance, including reading, writing, math, science, and social studies scores. It performs data exploration, visualizes feature distributions, and calculates correlation matrices. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A Decision Tree Regression model is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. Feature importance is analyzed, and the decision tree is visualized for interpretability. Finally, the project showcases how to use the trained model for predicting specific scenarios.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script containing the code.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Decision Tree Regression model, evaluate its performance, visualize feature importance, plot the decision tree, and demonstrate how to use the trained model for making predictions on new data points.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is assumed to be available locally in the project directory, named hsb2~data.csv.
